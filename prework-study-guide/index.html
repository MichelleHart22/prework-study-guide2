        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create/start the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Elements? An element is a type of content on a webpage. Text elements, image elements, header elements and list elements are commonly used to add content to pages.</li>
          <li>Elements can also be used to divide content on a webpage, common ones include: Meta-related elements, Content division elements and Semantic elements.</li>
          <li>Difference between Elements and Tags.  Elements are the entire element, open to close tags. Tags are what appears inside angle brackets.</li>
          <li>2 Important elements to understand the structure of an HTML page are Head and Body elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Head elements contain information(metadata) which allows the browser to render the page correctly. Elements within head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>Meta and Title elements are found in the Head element.  Only title is visible.</li>
          <li>Common items at the beginning on an HTML doc are !DOCTYPE html, html language"en" is english, head, meta, title.</li>
          <li>The body element represent the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Body elements contain content that is shown to users. Only items placed in the body element can be seen or interacted with by the user.</li>
          <li>The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. Note: There can only be one body element in an HTML document.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of semantic HTML element.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>It is important to use semantic HTML elements in the body because it makes your HTML easier to read by other developers and browser, use whenever possible.</li>

         <h2>CSS</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage with CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet and external style sheet.</li>
            <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.  This is less flexible than the other two because each inline style must be edited individually.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS Style Sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section for the HTML file and a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
            <li>External CSS Style Sheet is the most preferred style sheet because it allows developers to keep all there CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier. Also keeps content and styles seperate.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allows us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute w/ a class selector.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. Property is color and the value for that property is blue.</ul>
