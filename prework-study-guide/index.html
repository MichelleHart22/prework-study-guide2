        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create/start the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Elements? An element is a type of content on a webpage. Text elements, image elements, header elements and list elements are commonly used to add content to pages.</li>
          <li>Elements can also be used to divide content on a webpage, common ones include: Meta-related elements, Content division elements and Semantic elements.</li>
          <li>Difference between Elements and Tags.  Elements are the entire element, open to close tags. Tags are what appears inside angle brackets.</li>
          <li>2 Important elements to understand the structure of an HTML page are Head and Body elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Head elements contain information(metadata) which allows the browser to render the page correctly. Elements within head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>Meta and Title elements are found in the Head element.  Only title is visible.</li>
          <li>Common items at the beginning on an HTML doc are !DOCTYPE html, html language"en" is english, head, meta, title.</li>
          <li>The body element represent the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Body elements contain content that is shown to users. Only items placed in the body element can be seen or interacted with by the user.</li>
          <li>The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. Note: There can only be one body element in an HTML document.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of semantic HTML element.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>It is important to use semantic HTML elements in the body because it makes your HTML easier to read by other developers and browser, use whenever possible.</li>

         <h2>CSS</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage with CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet and external style sheet.</li>
            <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.  This is less flexible than the other two because each inline style must be edited individually.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS Style Sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section for the HTML file and a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
            <li>External CSS Style Sheet is the most preferred style sheet because it allows developers to keep all there CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier. Also keeps content and styles seperate.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allows us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute w/ a class selector.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. Property is color and the value for that property is blue.</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>Git tracks changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others we use another tool, GitHub.</li>
          <li>Github is a cloud based service that allows you  to keep track of projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>Commonly used git commands: </li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git status</li>
          <li>git add -A</li>
          <li>git commit -m "add starter code"</li>
          <li>git pull origin main</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/branch we are locally working in</li>
          <li>This creates a pull request, select create pull request, select Merge Pull Request and confirm.  You have now added your local branch into your main branch.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable (var) is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>JavaScript code goes near the bottom of your HTML page, place just before the closing body tag.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword, name should be unique because that is how we will reference info stored in that variable.</li>
          <li>An assignment operator = (equal sign) is used to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>A topic variable contains a string that includes all of the topics.</li>
          <li>Console.log method is used to output a message to the web cole by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>View console.log by clicking CTRL+Shift+I.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>We define topics AFTER we tell the computer to log it in the console.</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interupted, however.  We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>Conditonal statement if- is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. When using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>If a condition isnt true or has a value that isnt truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>An array is storing a group of related data in a variable.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>In order to use the for loop, we need the index and the array length.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead you call the funtion by name in order to execute it, this makes a code more easliy reusable.</li>
          <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword, similar to the var keyword to declare a new variable. Then we give our function a unique name. We will use this unique name whenever we call the function.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ().</li>
          <li>Call a function, To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute.</li>
