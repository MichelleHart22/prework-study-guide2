# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to create this Study Guide webpage to help me prepare for my upcoming coursework. I built this Study Guide project as a study tool to help me with this certificate program. I learned that a lot of detail and work goes into creating a website.  Repetition is key.

I have listed some quick notes on how to create an HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript file. There are detailed notes under each of the four sections. On the website we can open DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework so choose one topic to study first.
